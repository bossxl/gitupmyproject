gitupmyproject
==============

Run Git-Up on my whole directory...
Can be configured to exclude files using a repo.config.json file
npm install -g gitupmyproject

run: repoupdate

This works on Mac OSX. I haven't tired it on windows and don't plan to. Mostly likely will work on linux.

Any ideas that you want, add as an issue. Will consider anything and everything since this is so barebones
